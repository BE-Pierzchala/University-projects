This code is not well documented, and at this time I don't really remember how it works but I'm planning to get back to it...

I used to know a person who would say 'yes' quite a lot, so I've written a program to measure the timings and frequency of it, to see what distribution
it had. It's a simple program that writes into a file upon a button press the number of occurence and its timing. 
There also is a plot of few measurements, but the analysis code was written in MATLAB, which I don't use anymore, so it will have to be rewritten.
